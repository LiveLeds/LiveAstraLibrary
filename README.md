### LiveAstraLibrary


Kicad Library with STP and WRL 3D models.

Designed mostly for use with JLCPCB.

Some components were copied from the Kicad Library directly.

It's useful for CI systems to avoid the need to download all KiCad library components, everything is self contained in this repository.
